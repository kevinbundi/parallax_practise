			<h3>Soccer Stadiums</h3>
			<p>UEFA stadium categories are categories for football stadiums laid out in the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations.[1] Using these regulations, stadiums are rated as category one, two, three, or four (renamed from elite) in ascending ranking order. These categories replaced the previous method of ranking stadiums on one to five star scale in 2006.  A stadium must be category four to host games in the playoffs of the qualifying stage for the UEFA Champions League or any game in the main competition.[2] Category four is also required to host any game in the main competition of the UEFA Europa League[3] or the UEFA European Football Championship.[4]</p>

			<p>If a retractable roof is present, its use will be directed by consultation between the UEFA delegate and the main assigned referee.</p>
			<p>Although the minimum stadium capacity for category four is 8,000, no stadium with a capacity less than 30,000 has been selected to host a UEFA Europa League Final, and no stadium with a capacity less than 60,000 has been selected to host a UEFA Champions League Final, since these regulations were introduced in 2006.</p>
			<p>After the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, UEFA President Michel Platini stated that he wanted European Cup finals to be held at stadiums with an average capacity of 70,000 to solve security issues.[5] The hosts for the finals between 2009 and 2013 (Stadio Olimpico, Santiago Bernabéu, Wembley Stadium and Allianz Arena) all had capacities of at least 70,000, but the 2014 host (Estádio da Luz) only holds 65,000 spectators.</p>

			<p>Finally, stadium capacities for hosting music concerts should never[opinion] be included in the list since such use normally permits the audience to stand on the stadium's playing surface - especially if such concerts are only ever staged during limited periods of the year (such as the summer "closed season" in most football sports) - as both of these usage qualities clearly fall under the definition of "one-off", "temporary" or "secondary" use rather than "regular", "permanent" or "primary" use.[citation needed]</p>
			<p>All stadiums with a capacity of 25,000 or more are included. The list includes all such stadiums in any country which is commonly accepted to be within the borders of Europe, including transcontinental countries that are partially in Europe (e.g., Russia and Turkey), or in a non-European country commonly thought to be European for cultural or historic reasons (e.g., Israel, Cyprus, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia).[citation needed]</p>
